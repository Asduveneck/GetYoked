GetYoked is a fitness app to help you get exercise daily. Select a workout category and GetYoked will suggest a workout for you; you don't have to do any of the planning yourself!  

### Technology Stack

  Get Yoked is built using Full Stack JavaScript.
  - MongoDB is used as a NoSQL database
  - Express functions as an API to access user and workout information 
  - React components were used on the frontend with Redux to manage state
  - Node.js as a server environment 

### How to Use 

Once you've signed up or logged in, select one of the buttons to choose a `workout category`. Once you've worked out, click the button saying you've completed the workout and it'll be stored in your profile.

### To-dos and Future Features

  1. The ability to choose specific workouts or find workouts by more specific parameters.
  2. Images to accompany workouts
  3. Social features allowing users to interact with others (facilitating more of a community).
